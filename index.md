## Projects
1. **Network Infrastructure under Compound Extremes.[NICE]** (May 2021-Present)\
   - Funded by US Department of Defense(DoD).This hypothesis-guided research will lead to novel frameworks and
models for improving the science of resilience with an ultimate, long-term view of providing actionable insights for
ensuring DoD’s readiness to unknown and possibly unknowable compounding risks.

1. **Compound flooding impact on lifeline infrastructure network.** (Fall 2021-Present)\
   - Understanding of resilience(robustness and recovery) of lifeline infrastructures specifically mass transit railway
network in greater Boston area examined under compound flooding(coastal flooding and sea level rise).

1. **Characterization and delineation of multi model ensembles and multiple initial model ensemble based on complex network analysis.** (Fall 2021-Present)\
   - Distinguishing between multiple model ensembles and multiple initial model ensemble and their dynamics using
complex network.Exploring geo-clusters,spatial patterns predictive insights,climate dynamics using CMIP6 output
data.

1. **Improving resilience of lifeline infrastructures with network topology and dynamics.** (Fall 2021-Present)\
   - Analysing infrastructure network(New York MTA network) topology and dynamics(flows of physical quantities in
the network) to assess robustness.
